# ZCHPC AI-Driven Predictive Scheduling System

An intelligent, AI-powered job scheduling and resource optimization system for the Zimbabwe Centre for High Performance Computing (ZCHPC).

## Overview

This system uses machine learning models to predict job resource requirements, optimize scheduling decisions, and improve overall cluster utilization. By analyzing historical job data, the system makes accurate predictions about job runtime, memory usage, and CPU requirements, leading to better resource allocation and reduced job wait times.

## Features

- **Machine Learning-based Resource Prediction**: Accurately predicts job runtime, memory usage, and CPU requirements
- **Intelligent Job Scheduling**: Uses predictions to optimize scheduling decisions
- **HPC Scheduler Integration**: Works with existing SLURM and PBS/Torque schedulers
- **Simulation Environment**: Test and evaluate different scheduling strategies
- **Shadow Mode**: Run alongside existing schedulers without disrupting production workloads
- **Performance Metrics**: Track prediction accuracy and resource utilization improvements
